      <p>
        I love creating eye catching, minimalist, and innovative websites that can elevate businesses. 
        When not coding, I like to hike, pick up new hobbies (so far I have learned how to play a few string instruments, embroidery, and sewing), and trying new restaurants in Boston, although, I love homecooked meals.
